{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Services should not shadow read methods on repositories for other services" />}}	
	

## Why
- bloat the codebase by services shadowing repositories
- services import too many other services (better use repositories)
- better distinction between write behavior (services) and reading data (repositories)

## Patterns
- services use repositories to read data
- services can use other services for writing data
- controllers could use service to read data

## Anti-patterns
- services shadowing read operations on its main repositories, not adding any functionality


## Example anti patterns

```scala

@Singleton
class UserService @Inject() (
    val userRepository: UserRepository
)(implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext, val tracingService: TracingService) {


  def findRootUser: ReadDBIO[Option[UserWithMetaData]] =
    userRepository.findRootUser

  def findUserByEmail(userEmail: String): ReadDBIO[Option[UserWithMetadataAndRoles]] =
    userRepository.findUserByEmail(userEmail)

}


```
